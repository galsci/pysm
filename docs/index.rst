PySM Documentation
==================

PySM 3 generates full-sky simulations of Galactic foregrounds in intensity and polarization relevant for CMB experiments. The components simulated are: thermal dust, synchrotron, AME, free-free, and CMB at a given HEALPix $N_{side}$, with an option to integrate over a bandpass and to smooth with a given beam.

There is scope for a few options for the model for each component, attempting to be consistent with current data.

Currently much of the available data is limited in resolution at degree-scale. We therefore make efforts to provide reasonable small-scale simulations to extend the data to higher multipoles. The details of the procedures developed can be found in the accompanying paper.

This code is based on the large-scale Galactic part of `Planck Sky Model <http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/~delabrou/PSM/psm.html>`_ (`Delabrouille 2012 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3675>`_) code and uses some of its inputs.

Models
------

Each model is identified with a letter and a number, the letter indicates the kind of emission and the number the type of model, generally in order of complexity starting at 1. For example for dust we start with `d1` based on Planck commander results, `d4` has 2 dust populations and `d6` implements a model of dust frequency decorrelation.

For example free-free:

    **f1**: We model the free-free emission using the analytic model assumed in the Commander fit to the Planck 2015 data (Draine 2011 Physics of the Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium) to produce a degree-scale map of free-free emission at 30 GHz. We add small scales to this using a procedure outlined in the accompanying paper. This map is then scaled in frequency by applying a spatially constant power law index of -2.14.

Best practices for model execution
----------------------------------

PySM 3, in order to have the same behaviour of PySM 2, uses `hp.ud_grade` to change the resolution of the map if the HEALPix $N_{side}$ of the input templates is different from the requested output resolution, specified in the emission class (subclass of :py:class:`~pysm3.Model`) or in the :py:class:`~pysm3.Sky` class.

`hp.ud_grade` generally creates artifacts in the spectra and should be avoided unless the specific application can tolerate that.

Therefore we recommend to execute all PySM 2 derived models (e.g. `d0` to `d8`) at their native $N_{side}$ of 512, and then use the `output_nside` parameter of :py:func:`apply_smoothing_and_coord_transform` to transform to the target resolution, whether higher or lower, in Spherical Harmonics domain.

PySM 3 native models (e.g. `d9` to `d11` and `s4` to `s6`) instead have precomputed templates (generated in Spherical Harmonics domain) from $N_{side}$ 2048 to 8192. Therefore we recommend to execute them at 2048 if the target $N_{side}$ is 1024 or lower and at 2*$N_{side}$ if the target is 2048 or higher, except 8192 which is the highest possible resolution.

There are some exceptions, so always check in the documentation or the `max_nside` parameter of the models, for example the `d12` model, even if native to PySM 3, uses externally provided maps which are only available at $N_{side}$=2048.

Dependencies
============

PySM is written in pure Python, multi-threading and Just-In-Time compilation are provided by `numba`.
The required packages are:

* `healpy`
* `numba`
* `toml`
* `astropy`
* `importlib_metadata` just for Python 3.7

How many threads are used by `numba` can be controlled by setting::

    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
    export NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=2

For debugging purposes, you can also completely disable the `numba` JIT compilation and have the code just use plain
Python, which is slower, but easier to debug::

    export NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1

Run PySM with MPI support
-------------------------

PySM 3 is capable of running across multiple nodes using a MPI communicator.

See the details in the `MPI section of the tutorial <mpi.ipynb>`_.

In order to run in parallel with MPI, it also needs a functioning MPI environment and:

* `mpi4py`

MPI-Distributed smoothing (optional) requires `libsharp`, it is easiest to install the conda package::

    conda install -c conda-forge libsharp=*=*openmpi*

It also has a `mpich` version::

    conda install -c conda-forge libsharp=*=*mpich*


Installation
============

The easiest way to install the last release is to use `conda`::

    conda install -c conda-forge pysm3

or `pip`::

    pip install pysm3

See the `changelog on Github <https://github.com/galsci/pysm/blob/main/CHANGES.rst>`_ for details about what is included in each release.

Install at NERSC
----------------

Optionally replace with a newer anaconda environment::

    module load python/3.7-anaconda-2019.10
    conda create -c conda-forge -n pysm3 pysm3 python=3.7 ipython
    conda activate pysm3
    module unload python

Development install
-------------------

The development version is available in the `main` branch of the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/galsci/pysm>`_,
you can clone and install it with::

    pip install .

Create a development installation with::

    pip install -e .

Install the requirements for testing with::

    pip install -e .[test]

Execute the unit tests with::

    pytest

Configure verbosity
-------------------

PySM uses the `logging` module to configure its verbosity,
by default it will only print warnings and errors.

A log of useful information, for example intermediate results and timing can be
accessed enabling the `INFO` level of logging.
We provide a simplified function to configure this.

    pysm3.set_verbosity()

By default this sets verbosity to `INFO`, otherwise you can specify a level:

    pysm3.set_verbosity(logging.DEBUG)

To configure logging
you can access the "pysm3" logger with::

    import logging
    log = logging.getLogger("pysm3")

configure the logging level::

    log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

redirect the logs to the console::

    handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    log.addHandler(handler)

or customize their format::

    log_format="%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
    formatter = logging.Formatter(log_format)
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)

For more details see the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`_.
