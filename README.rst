PySM 3
======

PySM generates full-sky simulations of Galactic emissions in intensity
and polarization relevant to CMB experiments. It is a large refactor of
`PySM 2 <https://github.com/bthorne93/PySM_public>`__ focused on
reducing memory usage, improving performance and run in parallel with
MPI.

See the documentation at https://pysm3.readthedocs.io

See changes in ``CHANGES.rst`` in the repository.

Install
-------

See the `documentation <https://pysm3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation>`_

* Install with ``pip install .`` or with ``pip install .[test]`` to also install the requirements for running tests
* Optionally, if you have an MPI environment available and you would like to test the MPI capabilities of PySM, install ``mpi4py`` and ``libsharp``, check the documentation link above for more details.
* Check code style with ``tox -e codestyle``
* Test with ``pytest`` or ``tox -e test``
* Building docs requires ``pandoc``, not the python package, the actual ``pandoc`` command line tool, install it with conda or your package manager
* Build docs locally with ``tox -e build_docs``

Support
-------

For any question or issue with the software `open an issue <https://github.com/galsci/pysm/issues/>`_.

Release
-------

* Tag the new version with git
* Make sure ``hatch`` detects the right version with ``hatch version``
* Build with ``harch build``
* Upload to pypi with ``hatch publish``
* Upload to Github with ``git push --tags``
